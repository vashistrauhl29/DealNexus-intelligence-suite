# Governance Rules

## Escalation Protocol

The following escalation rules are mandatory for all agents participating in the customer discovery assessment process.

### 1. Custom Build Requirement

**Trigger:** Any agent detects a "Custom Build" requirement from transcript analysis or client communication.

**Action:** The detecting agent MUST immediately consult the **PM Agent** for timeline impact assessment before proceeding.

**Rationale:** Custom builds affect project timelines, resource allocation, and delivery commitments. The PM Agent must evaluate and document the impact on the overall project schedule.

---

### 2. Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

**Trigger:** A client mentions "Personal Identifiable Information (PII)" or any data handling requirements involving sensitive personal data.

**Action:** The **Legal Agent** MUST be triggered to add a "Security Wrapper" section to the report.

**Rationale:** PII handling carries regulatory and compliance obligations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). The Legal Agent ensures proper security measures and compliance language are documented.

---

### 3. Margin Target Validation

**Trigger:** Final report generation is requested.

**Action:** No final report can be generated unless the **Finance Agent** confirms the "Margin Target" is met.

**Rationale:** All deals must meet minimum profitability thresholds. The Finance Agent serves as the final gatekeeper to ensure business viability before report completion.
