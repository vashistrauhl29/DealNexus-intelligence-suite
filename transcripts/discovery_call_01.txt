PARTICIPANTS: Sarah (Glean Outcomes Manager), Mark (Global Logistics Corp, VP Operations), Elena (Global Logistics Corp, IT Director).

TRANSCRIPT SUMMARY: Mark: "Our main issue is speed. When a shipment gets stuck in customs, our agents spend 45 minutes just looking for the right compliance PDF or the previous email thread in Outlook. We use Slack, Google Drive, and Jira, but everything is siloed." Elena: "We also have a proprietary legacy database called 'LogiBase'. It holds all our historical shipping data and employee records, including some sensitive PII. It doesn't have a modern API—just a direct SQL connection. We need Glean to index that so we can find old shipment resolutions." Sarah: "That sounds like a significant bottleneck. How long does it take to onboard a new agent to handle these customs issues?" Mark: "Too long. About 6 weeks. Most of that time is spent learning where information is hidden. If we could cut that in half, the ROI would be massive." Elena: "Security is my biggest worry. If Glean indexes LogiBase, how do we ensure a junior agent doesn't see sensitive employee payroll data stored in the same SQL tables?"
